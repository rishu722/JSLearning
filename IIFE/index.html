      the pollution which is occured from global variable to remove that we use
      the IIFE

    <p>IIFE :Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)</p>
    <h4>Use cases</h4>
    <p>
      Avoid polluting the global namespace<br /> Because our application could include
      many functions and global variables from different source files, it's
      important to limit the number of global variables. If we have some
      initiation code that we don't need to use again, we could use the IIFE
      pattern. As we will not reuse the code again, using IIFE in this case is
      better than using a function declaration or a function expression.
