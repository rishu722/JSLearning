    <p>
      Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
      calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
      and height in meters)
    </p>
    Your task is to write some code to help them:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark,
        heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in
        two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.
      </li>
      <li>Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.</li>
      <li>
        BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information
        about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too
      </li>
    </ol>
    <script>
      //step 1
      const massMark = 78;
      const heightMark = 1.69;
      const massJohn = 92;
      const heightJohn = 1.95;

      //step 2
      const BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
      const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

      //step 3
      console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn);

      //step 4
      const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
      console.log(markHigherBMI);
    </script>
  </body>
