    <p>
      Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a
      new gymnastics discipline, which works differently. Each team competes 3
      times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average
      score per team). A team only wins if it has at least double the average
      score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!
    </p>
    <h4>Your tasks:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create an arrow function calcAverage to calculate the average of 3
        scores. This function should have three parameters and return a single
        number (the average score).
      </li>
      <li>
        Create two new variables â€” scoreDolphins and scoreKoalas, and assign the
        value returned from the calcAverage function to them (you will need to
        call this function, and pass scores as arguments).
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a function checkWinner that takes the average score of each team
        as parameters (avgDolphins and avgKoalas), and then logs the winner to
        the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule
        above. Example: Koalas win (30 vs. 13) (use avgDolphins and avgKoalas
        instead of hard-coded values).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the checkWinner function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and
        DATA 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ignore draws this time. Instead, log No team wins... to the console if
        there is no winner.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <script>
      const calcAverage = (a, b, c) => {
        return (a + b + c) / 3;
      };
      const scoreDolphins = calcAverage(85, 54, 41);
      const scoreKoalas = calcAverage(23, 34, 27);
      function checkWinner(avgDolphins, avgKoalas) {
        if (avgKoalas > avgDolphins) {
          console.log(`Koalas win (${avgKoalas} vs. ${avgDolphins})`);
        } else if (avgDolphins > avgKoalas) {
          console.log(`Dolphins win (${avgDolphins} vs. ${avgKoalas})`);
        } else {
          console.log(`tie (${avgDolphins} vs. ${avgKoalas})`);
        }
      }
      checkWinner(scoreDolphins, scoreKoalas);
    </script>
