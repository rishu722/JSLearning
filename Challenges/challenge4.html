      Steven needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a
      restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is
      between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
    </p>
    <h4>Your tasks:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called
        tip for this. It's not allowed to use an if...else statement (if it's
        easier for you, you can start with an if...else statement, and then try
        to convert it to a ternary operator).
      </li>
      <li>
        Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and
        the final value (bill + tip). Example: The bill was 275, the tip was
        41.25, and the total value 316.25.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <script>
      let bill = 270;
      const tip =
        bill > 50 && bill <= 300 ? (bill * 15) / 100 : (bill * 20) / 100;
      totalBill = bill + tip;
      console.log(
        `The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${totalBill}`
      );
    </script>
  </body>
