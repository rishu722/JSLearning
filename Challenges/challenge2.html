        Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher
        BMI. The message can be either: "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or
        "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".
      </li>
      <li>
        Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI
        values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's
        (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!". Note: Don't
        round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.

      const BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
      const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
      console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn);
      if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
        console.log("Mark's BMI is higher than John's!");
      } else {
        console.log("John's BMI is higher than Mark's!");
