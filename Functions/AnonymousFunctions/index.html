    <h1>Anonymous Functions</h1>
    <p>
      An anonymous function is a function that is created without a name. In
      other words, it is a function that is defined inline and does not have a
      reference identifier. Anonymous functions can be assigned to variables,
      passed as arguments to other functions, or returned from functions as
      values. The main advantage of anonymous functions is that they allow for
      more concise and readable code.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anonymous functions do not have any name</li>
      <li>
        We can write an anonymous function using the function keyword, followed
        by parentheses ().
      </li>
      <li>
        We can write the function statements, just like we do for any other
        javascript function inside the curly parentheses {}.
      </li>
      <li>
        We store the results returned by an anonymous function in variables.
      </li>
    </ul>
