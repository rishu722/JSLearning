    <h1>Hoisting</h1>
    <p>
      Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function
      declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the
      compilation phase. This means that you can use variables and functions
      before they are declared in your code.

    <script>
      console.log(x); // undefined
      var x = 5;
      console.log(x); // 5

      sayHello(); // Hello will print

      function sayHello() {
        console.log("Hello!");
      }
